RateMyBuffs - Justin Olson, Conner Simmering, Samuel Volin

RateMyBuffs is a chrome extension that displays UCB professor and class ratings inside MyCU's course registration pages. This allows students to quickly compare professors and classes and optimize their class schedules.

RateMyBuffs links directly to professor and class cufcq.com pages, providing detailed and accurate data regarding individual professors and classes.

Cufcq.com collects its data from the office of planning and budget's publicly available fcq files on http://www.colorado.edu/fcq/. The university collects its data each semester from students who fill out fcq forms in class.

To use RateMyBuffs, add the extension to your chrome browser, and search for a class!
